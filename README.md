📸 Full Page Screenshot Exporter

Full Page Screenshot Exporter is a modern Chrome extension that allows you to capture entire webpages exactly as they appear and export them as PDF, PNG, or JPEG files. It automatically scrolls long pages, stitches screenshots seamlessly, and runs completely locally in your browser for maximum privacy.

✨ Features

🖼️ Multiple Export Formats – Export screenshots as PDF, PNG, or JPEG

🌙 Dark Mode Export – Apply dark mode only to the exported file

✂️ Selection Area Capture – Capture a specific region of the page

👁️ Visible Area Capture – Capture only the currently visible viewport

⚡ Fast & Lightweight – Optimized for speed with minimal resource usage

🧠 How It Works

The extension scrolls the page automatically, captures screenshots viewport by viewport, and stitches them together using an offscreen document. Exporting is handled efficiently to ensure high-quality output without blocking the browser.
